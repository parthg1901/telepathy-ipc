# Telepathy
An On-Chain Strategy Game built using IPC and Godot to test your remembering skills.

## How to run
1. Clone [Telepathy Godot](https://github.com/parthg1901/telepathy-godot) and [Export as HTML5](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html) to run the game.
2. Start your subnet from the repo.
3. Join as a validator.
4. Deploy contracts from [Telepathy Contracts](telepathy-contracts) Folder (using hardhat ignition)
5. Go to the game and enter player number and contract address.

It is a long process for now, but it'll shorten once I create multiple levels for the game.
